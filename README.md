## Description
> How many times did you wanted to go back and continue with the last session of listening to your new discovered albums?

> Did you want to remember how that album felt to you after you listened it?

> Or you just want to keep track of everything you listen without having to remember everything inside your brain.

Well, the answer to this questions is **Trakabum**.

Trakabum is an app for people who wants to search and store their listened albums. Not only that, but you can have a rating system of the ones you have listened, as well as sorting and filtering all of them so you can focus on whats more important to you.

This is an <span style="color:#a6da95">android</span> application which uses the <span style="color:#a6da95">Spotify API</span> to retrieve information from the albums. In fact, we use a [library](https://github.com/adamint/spotify-web-api-kotlin) which has a bunch of implementations of the API already built in, so it is easier for us to develop the application to the public.
## Features
- **Cartonny & beautiful UI**: Based on Excalidraw's design with a cartonny design style.
- **Search and browse albums**: Use the integrated search functionality to find albums based on artists, genres, or specific keywords.
- **Album details**: View detailed information about each album, including the artist, release date, tracklist, album cover art and more!.
- **Add albums to your personal lists**: Save albums to your personal lists for easy access and reference.
- **Mark albums as listened**: Keep track of the albums you've already listened to by marking them as listened.
- **Create custom tags for each list**: You can create tags for the lists that you want so you can organize more your albums.
- **Notifications for new releases**: Receive notifications whenever new albums are released by your followed artists.
- **Personalized recommendations**: Get personalized album recommendations based on your listening preferences and saved albums.

## FAQ
- **Will this app be available in the App Store?** For now, we dont plan to release Trakabum on the App Store, but if we recieve enough requests about it, we will.
- **Can i have a tag for more than one list?** Yes, you can.
- **Has the app a triel or something like that?** Yes it does! It has a free trial version for you to try. The trial is only 7 days, so after the time has passed, you will have to pay to keep using the app.
- **Can i use the app without Spotify?** No, you cant. The Spotify API is the most important ingredient for the app to work, so unfortunely, we have to use it. Altough, about connecting with your Spotify account, **you can not log in with Spotify**, and use the app for only local querys and store local information.
- **I have a question that is not answered here, what can I do?** You can post an issue here on GitHub, write a review og Google Play or contact us via mail. You have the [contact information](#contact-information) down on the page.
